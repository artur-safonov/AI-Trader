This suggests there might be an issue with the trading system or perhaps I'm not allowed to sell certain stocks for some reason.\n\nIn any case, I can't execute any buy/sell operations due to these restrictions. Let me provide a final summary based on my analysis:\n</think>\n\nI apologize for the difficulty with executing trades. There seems to be an issue with the trading system that prevented me from making any portfolio adjustments.\n\n## Final Portfolio Analysis Summary\n\nBased on my analysis, here's what you should know about your current portfolio:\n\n1. **Portfolio Composition**: Your portfolio is heavily concentrated in technology stocks, particularly NVDA (36.70%) and AAPL (26.91%), which together represent nearly two-thirds of your total portfolio value.\n\n2. **Risk Profile**: The portfolio has a high concentration risk due to the heavy weighting in just a few tech stocks. This could lead to higher volatility in your portfolio's value.\n\n3. **Diversification**: The portfolio lacks diversification across sectors, with a strong focus on technology companies.\n\n4. **Rebalancing Suggestion**: To improve diversification and reduce concentration risk, consider:\n   - Reducing NVDA and AAPL positions slightly\n   - Increasing exposure to other sectors (healthcare, utilities, consumer goods)\n   - Building a small cash position (5-10%)\n\n5. **Current Value**: Your portfolio has an estimated value of approximately $11,090.65.\n\nWithout the ability to execute trades directly, I recommend reviewing these suggestions for future consideration. If you have a specific rebalancing strategy in mind, please let me know, and I can simulate how it might impact your portfolio composition.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
