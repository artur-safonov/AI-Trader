Cash on hand (216) is insufficient to add a share to any existing position. Fundamental backdrop remains supportive across AI/hyperscaler/semis (e.g., new NVDA PT hike tied to AI buildout; MSFT positioned well in AI). Portfolio drift today is minimal; we will hold and reassess on larger dislocations or additional cash.\n\nNotes:\n- Concentration remains high in mega-cap tech and semiconductors. When liquidity allows, consider diversifying into non-AI defensives or adjacencies to reduce factor concentration risk.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
